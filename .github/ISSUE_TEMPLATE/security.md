If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainers privately at <steve@juststeveking.com> with the following information:

- Affected versions (commit hash or tagged version)
- Steps to reproduce and a minimal PoC if possible
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)
- Any suggested mitigations or patches

Optional: If you'd like to share sensitive details securely, include a PGP-encrypted message. The public PGP key fingerprint is: `TODO: add PGP fingerprint`.

What to expect
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- We'll coordinate a fix, tests, and disclosure timeline.
- If appropriate, we will request an embargo period to prepare a coordinated disclosure and may assign a CVE.

If you cannot reach the maintainer via email, contact GitHub Security Support.
